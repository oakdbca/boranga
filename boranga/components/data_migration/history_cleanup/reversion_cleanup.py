"""
Utilities for cleaning up django-reversion history during data migrations.

This module provides efficient bulk deletion of django-reversion Version records
when clearing target data with `--wipe-targets`, particularly when filtering by
group_type (flora, fauna, community).

Note: This module is in 'history_cleanup' package to avoid shadowing the main
      'utils.py' module that contains general utility functions.

Usage:
    from boranga.components.data_migration.history_cleanup.reversion_cleanup import ReversionHistoryCleaner

    cleaner = ReversionHistoryCleaner(batch_size=2000)
    cleaner.clear_species_and_related({'group_type__name__in': ['flora']})
    logger.info("Deleted versions: %s", cleaner.get_stats())
"""
