-- Flora OCC Boundary All  (KB Report)
-- DevOps Task #15555
-- Frequency: Monthly
--
-- One row per OccurrenceGeometry (Polygon type) for Flora Occurrences.
-- Returns ALL processing statuses.
--
-- NOTE: OCC_MOD_BY is resolved via accounts_emailuser and returns
-- first_name || ' ' || last_name for the last user to modify the record.
--
-- NOTE: OBS_DATE is sourced from boranga_occplantcount (plant_count.obs_date).
--
-- IMPORTANT — KB does not allow comments in SQL queries. Before pasting this
-- script into KB, strip all comments using:
