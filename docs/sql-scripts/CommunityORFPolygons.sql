-- Community ORF Polygons  (KB Report)
-- DevOps Task #15552
-- Frequency: Monthly
--
-- One row per OccurrenceReportGeometry (Polygon type) for Community OCRs.
-- Returns ALL processing statuses.
--
-- NOTE: ORF_MOD_BY is resolved via accounts_emailuser and returns
-- first_name || ' ' || last_name for the last user to modify the record.
--
-- IMPORTANT — KB does not allow comments in SQL queries. Before pasting this
-- script into KB, strip all comments using:
--   python scripts/strip_sql_comments.py docs/sql-scripts/CommunityORFPolygons.sql
-- Or write the result to a file for easy copying:
