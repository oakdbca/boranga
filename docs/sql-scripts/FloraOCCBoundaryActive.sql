-- Flora OCC Boundary Active  (KB Report)
-- DevOps Task #15554
-- Frequency: Daily
--
-- One row per OccurrenceGeometry (Polygon type) for Flora Occurrences.
-- Filters:
--   - OCC Processing Status = Active only
--   - Species must have a current Approved Conservation Status
--
-- NOTE: OBS_DATE is sourced from boranga_occplantcount (plant_count.obs_date).
--
-- IMPORTANT — KB does not allow comments in SQL queries. Before pasting this
-- script into KB, strip all comments using:

-- Or write the result to a file for easy copying:
